## BLM305

This is a sample of collaborative work

GUI is the main class that does three things:
* finds all class files in the project directory
* loads all implementations of Quotation into a HashMap
* selects an implementation and invokes related methods

Your task is to make another Quotation class:
* fork this depository to your user
* make a local copy and add your class
* compile it and run GUI again
* upload your java file and make a pull request
