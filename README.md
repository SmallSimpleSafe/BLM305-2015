## BLM305

This is a sample of collaborative work

GUI is the main class that does three things:
* finds all class files in the project directory
* loads all implementations of Quotation into a HashMap
* selects an implementation and invokes related methods

Your task is to make another Quotation class:
* fork this repository to your user
* make a local copy and add your class
* compile it and run GUI again
* upload your java file and make a pull request

Two bat files are added for synchronizing your repository:
* sync: pull from your fork and push local changes to the fork
* update: pull from the upstream and push to your fork

When you update using the desktop interface, you end up with an undesirable merge-commit

Try update.bat instead -- If that doesn't work, you have probably modified someone else's files
